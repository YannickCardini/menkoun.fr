# Simple Design Website :cool:

I feel that the simpler the better, both from a developer and a user standpoint.
This light website use JavaScript/HTML/CSS/JQuery.

## How to get started :stars:

Just open [index.html](src/index.html) with a browser or run it on docker.

## Docker :whale:

```
docker build -t simple-website .
docker run -it --rm -d -p 8080:80 --name simplewebsite simple-website && docker attach simplewebsite
```
